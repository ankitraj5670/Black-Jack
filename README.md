# Blackjack Game

This is a implementation of a Blackjack game using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI. The game allows the player to play against the dealer, with options to hit or stand.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
3. Once the game starts, you will see your initial hand and one card from the dealer's hand.
4. Click "Hit" if you want to be dealt another card. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
5. Click "Stand" when you are satisfied with your hand. This will end your turn and allow the dealer to play.
6. The game will then determine the winner based on the total value of each hand. If you win, a message will be displayed indicating so.
